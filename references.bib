We present an actor-critic, model-free algorithm based on the deterministic policy gradient that can operate over continuous action spaces. Using the same learning algorithm, network architecture and hyper-parameters, our algorithm robustly solves more than 20 simulated physics tasks, including classic problems such as cartpole swing-up, dexterous manipulation, legged locomotion and car driving. Our algorithm is able to find policies whose performance is competitive with those found by a planning algorithm with full access to the dynamics of the domain and its derivatives. We further demonstrate that for many of the tasks the algorithm can learn policies “end-to-end”: directly from raw pixel inputs.},

   abstract = {Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been demonstrated on a range of challenging decision making and control tasks. However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy-that is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actorcritic formulation, our method achieves state-ofthe-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior onpolicy and off-policy methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across different random seeds.},

   abstract = {Does progress in simulation translate to progress on robots? If one method outperforms another in simulation, how likely is that trend to hold in reality on a robot? We examine this question for embodied PointGoal navigation - developing engineering tools and a research paradigm for evaluating a simulator by its sim2real predictivity. First, we develop Habitat-PyRobot Bridge (HaPy), a library for seamless execution of identical code on simulated agents and robots - transferring simulation-trained agents to a LoCoBot platform with a one-line code change. Second, we investigate the sim2real predictivity of Habitat-Sim M. Savva et al., for PointGoal navigation. We 3D-scan a physical lab space to create a virtualized replica, and run parallel tests of 9 different models in reality and simulation. We present a new metric called Sim-vs-Real Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) to quantify predictivity. We find that SRCC for Habitat as used for the CVPR19 challenge is low (0.18 for the success metric), suggesting that performance differences in this simulator-based challenge do not persist after physical deployment. This gap is largely due to AI agents learning to exploit simulator imperfections - abusing collision dynamics to 'slide' along walls, leading to shortcuts through otherwise non-navigable space. Naturally, such exploits do not work in the real world. Our experiments show that it is possible to tune simulation parameters to improve sim2real predictivity (e.g. improving SRCCSucc from 0.18 to 0.844) - increasing confidence that in-simulation comparisons will translate to deployed systems in reality.},

abstract = {Today, there are two major paradigms for vision-based autonomous driving systems: mediated perception approaches that parse an entire scene to make a driving decision, and behavior reflex approaches that directly map an input image to a driving action by a regressor. In this paper, we propose a third paradigm: a direct perception approach to estimate the affordance for driving. We propose to map an input image to a small number of key perception indicators that directly relate to the affordance of a road/traffic state for driving. Our representation provides a set of compact yet complete descriptions of the scene to enable a simple controller to drive autonomously. Falling in between the two extremes of mediated perception and behavior reflex, we argue that our direct perception representation provides the right level of abstraction. To demonstrate this, we train a deep Convolutional Neural Network using recording from 12 hours of human driving in a video game and show that our model can work well to drive a car in a very diverse set of virtual environments. We also train a model for car distance estimation on the KITTI dataset. Results show that our direct perception approach can generalize well to real driving images.

   abstract = {We present DeepPicar, a low-cost deep neural network based autonomous car platform. DeepPicar is a small scale replication of a real self-driving car called DAVE-2 by NVIDIA. DAVE-2 uses a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), which takes images from a front-facing camera as input and produces car steering angles as output. DeepPicar uses the same network architecture - 9 layers, 27 million connections and 250K parameters - and can drive itself in real-time using a web camera and a Raspberry Pi 3 quad-core platform. Using DeepPicar, we analyze the Pi 3's computing capabilities to support end-to-end deep learning based real-time control of autonomous vehicles. We also systematically compare other contemporary embedded computing platforms using the DeepPicar's CNN-based real-time control workload. We find that all tested platforms, including the Pi 3, are capable of supporting the CNN-based real-time control, from 20 Hz up to 100 Hz, depending on hardware platform. However, we find that shared resource contention remains an important issue that must be considered in applying CNN models on shared memory based embedded computing platforms; we observe up to 11.6X execution time increase in the CNN based control loop due to shared resource contention. To protect the CNN workload, we also evaluate state-of-the-art cache partitioning and memory bandwidth throttling techniques on the Pi 3. We find that cache partitioning is ineffective, while memory bandwidth throttling is an effective solution.},

@inproceedings{Desai2018,
   abstract = {The recent drive towards achieving greater autonomy and intelligence in robotics has led to high levels of complexity. Autonomous robots increasingly depend on third-party off-The-shelf components and complex machine-learning techniques. This trend makes it challenging to provide strong design-Time certification of correct operation. To address these challenges, we present SOTER, a robotics programming framework with two key components: (1) a programming language for implementing and testing high-level reactive robotics software, and (2) an integrated runtime assurance (RTA) system that helps enable the use of uncertified components, while still providing safety guarantees. SOTER provides language primitives to declaratively construct a RTA module consisting of an advanced, high-performance controller (uncertified), a safe, lower-performance controller (certified), and the desired safety specification. The framework provides a formal guarantee that a well-formed RTA module always satisfies the safety specification, without completely sacrificing performance by using higher performance uncertified components whenever safe. SOTER allows the complex robotics software stack to be constructed as a composition of RTA modules, where each uncertified component is protected using a RTA module. To demonstrate the efficacy of our framework, we consider a real-world case-study of building a safe drone surveillance system. Our experiments both in simulation and on actual drones show that the SOTER-enabled RTA ensures the safety of the system, including when untrusted third-party components have bugs or deviate from the desired behavior.},

This architecture enables the safe use of smart, high-performance, untrusted, and complex control algorithms to enable autonomy without requiring the smart controllers to be formally verified or certified. Simplex incorporates a supervisory controller that will take over control from the unverified complex/smart controller if it misbehaves and use a safety controller. The supervisory controller should (1) guarantee that the system never enters an unsafe state (safety), but should also (2) use the complex/smart controller as much as possible (minimize conservatism). The problem of precisely and correctly defining the switching logic of the supervisory controller has previously been considered either using a control-theoretic optimization approach or through an offline hybrid-systems reachability computation. In this work, we show that a combined online/offline approach that uses aspects of the two earlier methods, along with a real-time reachability computation, also maintains safety, but with significantly less conservatism, allowing the complex controller to be used more frequently. We demonstrate the advantages of this unified approach on a saturated inverted pendulum system, in which the verifiable region of attraction is over twice as large compared to the earlier approach. Additionally, to validate the claims that the real-time reachability approach may be implemented on embedded platforms, we have ported and conducted embedded hardware studies using both ARM processors and Atmel AVR microcontrollers. This is the first ever demonstration of a hybrid-systems reachability computation in real time on actual embedded platforms, which required addressing significant technical challenges.},

In this paper, we propose a real-time decentralized safety verification approach for a distributed multi-agent CPS with the underlying assumption that all agents are time-synchronized with a low degree of error. In the proposed approach, each agent periodically computes its local reachable set and exchanges this reachable set with the other agents with the goal of verifying the system safety. Our method, implemented in Java, takes advantages of the timing information and the reachable set information that are available in the exchanged messages to reason about the safety of the whole system in a decentralized manner. Any particular agent can also perform local safety verification tasks based on their local clocks by analyzing the messages it receives. We applied the proposed method to verify, in real-time, the safety properties of a group of quadcopters performing a distributed search mission.",

At the same time, knowledge gleamed from extended periods of execution can be exploited to reduce the uncertainties that were inevitably presented in the system models that are used to define the temporal behaviours of the control tasks. In this paper we utilise this knowledge and present an adaptation method that actively extends the period of control tasks at run-time based on historical measurements. This can lead to lower power consumption or to the accommodation of increased computation resource demands from other components of the CPS. The method relies on online monitoring and model-based prediction to degrade control performance while having a minimal and acceptable impact on ongoing operations. Cloud-based computing is used to facilitate decision making and offload the local computation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method through control-scheduling co-simulation."

abstract = {This paper proposes a new forward reachability analysis approach to verify safety of cyber-physical systems (CPS) with reinforcement learning controllers. The foundation of our approach lies on two efficient, exact and over-approximate reachability algorithms for neural network control systems using star sets, which is an efficient representation of polyhedra. Using these algorithms, we determine the initial conditions for which a safety-critical system with a neural network controller is safe by incrementally searching a critical initial condition where the safety of the system cannot be established. Our approach produces tight over-approximation error and it is computationally efficient, which allows the application to practical CPS with learning enable components (LECs). We implement our approach in NNV, a recent verification tool for neural networks and neural network control systems, and evaluate its advantages and applicability by verifying safety of a practical Advanced Emergency Braking System (AEBS) with a reinforcement learning (RL) controller trained using the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method. The experimental results show that our new reachability algorithms are much less conservative than existing polyhedra-based approaches. We successfully determine the entire region of the initial conditions of the AEBS with the RL controller such that the safety of the system is guaranteed, while a polyhedra-based approach cannot prove the safety properties of the system.},

Combining model checking with runtime verification helps us bridge the gap between software verification (discrete) that makes assumptions about the low-level controllers and the physical world, and the actual execution of the software on a real robotic platform in the physical world.

% Robust Online Monitoring of Signal Temporal Logic
@article{Deshmukh2015,
   abstract = {Signal temporal logic (STL) is a formalism used to rigorously specify requirements of cyberphysical systems (CPS), i.e., systems mixing digital or discrete components in interaction with a continuous environment or analog components. STL is naturally equipped with a quantitative semantics which can be used for various purposes: from assessing the robustness of a specification to guiding searches over the input and parameter space with the goal of falsifying the given property over system behaviors. Algorithms have been proposed and implemented for offline computation of such quantitative semantics, but only few methods exist for an online setting, where one would want to monitor the satisfaction of a formula during simulation. In this paper, we formalize a semantics for robust online monitoring of partial traces, i.e., traces for which there might not be enough data to decide the Boolean satisfaction (and to compute its quantitative counterpart). We propose an efficient algorithm to compute it and demonstrate its usage on two large scale real-world case studies coming from the automotive domain and from CPS education in a Massively Open Online Course setting. We show that savings in computationally expensive simulations far outweigh any overheads incurred by an online approach.},

 %Provably Safe and Robust Learning-Based Model Predictive Control
@article{aswani2012provably,
   abstract = {Controller design faces a trade-off between robustness and performance, and the reliability of linear controllers has caused many practitioners to focus on the former. However, there is renewed interest in improving system performance to deal with growing energy constraints. This paper describes a learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC) scheme that provides deterministic guarantees on robustness, while statistical identification tools are used to identify richer models of the system in order to improve performance; the benefits of this framework are that it handles state and input constraints, optimizes system performance with respect to a cost function, and can be designed to use a wide variety of parametric or nonparametric statistical tools. The main insight of LBMPC is that safety and performance can be decoupled under reasonable conditions in an optimization framework by maintaining two models of the system. The first is an approximate model with bounds on its uncertainty, and the second model is updated by statistical methods. LBMPC improves performance by choosing inputs that minimize a cost subject to the learned dynamics, and it ensures safety and robustness by checking whether these same inputs keep the approximate model stable when it is subject to uncertainty. Furthermore, we show that if the system is sufficiently excited, then the LBMPC control action probabilistically converges to that of an MPC computed using the true dynamics. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Formal verification and validation play a crucial role in making cyber-physical systems (CPS) safe. Formal methods make strong guarantees about the system behavior if accurate models of the system can be obtained, including models of the controller and of the physical dynamics. In CPS, models are essential; but any model we could possibly build necessarily deviates from the real world. If the real system fits to the model, its behavior is guaranteed to satisfy the correctness properties verified with respect to the model. Otherwise, all bets are off. This article introduces ModelPlex, a method ensuring that verification results about models apply to CPS implementations. ModelPlex provides correctness guarantees for CPS executions at runtime: it combines offline verification of CPS models with runtime validation of system executions for compliance with the model. ModelPlex ensures in a provably correct way that the verification results obtained for the model apply to the actual system runs by monitoring the behavior of the world for compliance with the model. If, at some point, the observed behavior no longer complies with the model so that offline verification results no longer apply, ModelPlex initiates provably safe fallback actions, assuming the system dynamics deviation is bounded. This article, furthermore, develops a systematic technique to synthesize provably correct monitors automatically from CPS proofs in differential dynamic logic by a correct-by-construction approach, leading to verifiably correct runtime model validation. Overall, ModelPlex generates provably correct monitor conditions that, if checked to hold at runtime, are provably guaranteed to imply that the offline safety verification results about the CPS model apply to the present run of the actual CPS implementation.},

abstract = {Distributed mobile robotics (DMR) involves teams of networked robots navigating in a physical space to achieve tasks in a coordinated fashion. A major challenge in DMR is to program the ensemble of robots with formal guarantees and high assurance of correct operation. To this end, we introduce Drona, a framework for building reliable DMR applications.This paper makes three central contributions: (1) We present a novel and provably correct decentralized asynchronous motion planner that can perform on-the-fly collision-free planning for dynamically generated tasks. Moreover, the motion planner is the first to take into account the fact that distributed robots may have clocks that are only synchronized up to a tolerance, i.e., they are almost synchronous; (2) We formalize the DMR system as a mixed-synchronous system, and present a sound abstraction-based verification approach for DMR systems, and (3) Drona provides a state-machine based language for safe event-driven programming of a DMR system and the code generated by the compiler can be executed on platforms such as the robot operating system (ROS).To demonstrate the efficacy of Drona, we build and verify a priority mail delivery system. Using our abstraction-based verification approach we were able to find, within a few minutes, bugs which could not be found by performing random simulation for several hours. Our verified decentralized motion-planner scales efficiently for large number of robots (upto 128 robots) and workspace sizes (upto a 256\texttimes{}256 grid).},

The Simplex architecture entails switching control of a plant over to a provably safe Baseline Controller when a safety violation is imminent under the control of an unverified Advanced Controller. A key step of determining the switching condition is identifying a recoverable region, where the Baseline Controller guarantees recovery and keeps the plant invariably safe. BaCs, which are Lyapunov-like proofs of safety, are used to identify a recoverable region. At each time step, the switching logic samples the state of the plant and uses bounded-time reachability analysis to conservatively check whether any states outside the zero-level set of the BaCs, which therefore might be non-recoverable, are reachable in one decision period under control of the Advanced Controller. If so, failover is initiated.",

The goal of this article is to analyse this state explosion problem from several perspectives. Many advanced state space methods alleviate the problem by using a subset or an abstraction of the set of states. Unfortunately, their use tends to restrict the set of analysis or verification questions that can be answered, making it impossible to discuss the methods without some taxonomy of the questions. Therefore, the article contains a lengthy discussion on alternative ways of stating analysis and verification questions, and algorithms for answering them. After that, many advanced state space methods are briefly described. The state explosion problem is investigated also from the computational complexity point of view.",

   abstract = {Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) reachability analysis is a powerful tool for analyzing the safety of autonomous systems. This analysis is computationally intensive and typically performed offline. Online, however, the autonomous system may experience changes in system dynamics, external disturbances, and/or the surrounding environment, requiring updated safety guarantees. Rather than restarting the safety analysis, we propose a method of warm-start reachability, which uses a user-defined initialization (typically the previously computed solution). By starting with an HJI function that is closer to the solution than the standard initialization, the analysis may take fewer iterations. In this paper we prove that warm-starting will result in guaranteed conservative solutions by over-approximating the states that must be avoided to maintain safety. We additionally prove that for many common problem formulations, warm-starting will result in exact solutions. We demonstrate our method on several illustrative examples with a double integrator, and also with a more practical 10D quadcopter model that experiences changes in mass and disturbances and must update its safety guarantees accordingly. We compare our approach to standard reachability and a recently proposed discounted reachability method, and find for our examples that warm-starting is 1:6 times faster than standard and 6:2 times faster than (untuned) discounted reachability.},

Since most of these systems are safety-critical, it is important to ensure they operate safely even when faced with environmental uncertainty. Current safety analysis tools enable autonomous systems to reason about safety given full information about the state of the environment a priori. However, these tools do not scale well to scenarios where the environment is being sensed in real time, such as during navigation tasks. In this work, we propose a novel, real-time safety analysis method based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability that provides strong safety guarantees despite the unknown parts of the environment. Our safety method is planner-agnostic and provides guarantees for a variety of mapping sensors. We demonstrate our approach in simulation and in hardware to provide safety guarantees around a state-of-the-art vision-based, learning-based planner.

   abstract = {Real-world autonomous systems often employ probabilistic predictive models of human behavior during planning to reason about their future motion. Since accurately modeling human behavior a priori is challenging, such models are often parameterized, enabling the robot to adapt predictions based on observations by maintaining a distribution over the model parameters. Although this enables data and priors to improve the human model, observation models are difficult to specify and priors may be incorrect, leading to erroneous state predictions that can degrade the safety of the robot motion plan. In this work, we seek to design a predictor which is more robust to misspecified models and priors, but can still leverage human behavioral data online to reduce conservatism in a safe way. To do this, we cast human motion prediction as a Hamilton-Jacobi reachability problem in the joint state space of the human and the belief over the model parameters. We construct a new continuous-time dynamical system, where the inputs are the observations of human behavior, and the dynamics include how the belief over the model parameters change. The results of this reachability computation enable us to both analyze the effect of incorrect priors on future predictions in continuous state and time, as well as to make predictions of the human state in the future. We compare our approach to the worst-case forward reachable set and a stochastic predictor which uses Bayesian inference and produces full future state distributions. Our comparisons in simulation and in hardware demonstrate how our framework can enable robust planning while not being overly conservative, even when the human model is inaccurate.

   abstract = {The proven efficacy of learning-based control schemes strongly motivates their application to robotic systems operating in the physical world. However, guaranteeing correct operation during the learning process is currently an unresolved issue, which is of vital importance in safety-critical systems. We propose a general safety framework based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability methods that can work in conjunction with an arbitrary learning algorithm. The method exploits approximate knowledge of the system dynamics to guarantee constraint satisfaction while minimally interfering with the learning process. We further introduce a Bayesian mechanism that refines the safety analysis as the system acquires new evidence, reducing initial conservativeness when appropriate while strengthening guarantees through real-Time validation. The result is a least-restrictive, safety-preserving control law that intervenes only when the computed safety guarantees require it, or confidence in the computed guarantees decays in light of new observations. We prove theoretical safety guarantees combining probabilistic and worst-case analysis and demonstrate the proposed framework experimentally on a quadrotor vehicle. Even though safety analysis is based on a simple point-mass model, the quadrotor successfully arrives at a suitable controller by policy-gradient reinforcement learning without ever crashing, and safely retracts away from a strong external disturbance introduced during flight.},

However, it is challenging to use model-based methods in settings where the environment is a priori unknown and can only be observed partially through onboard sensors on the robot. In this work, we address this short-coming by coupling model-based control with learning-based perception. The learning-based perception module produces a series of waypoints that guide the robot to the goal via a collision-free path. These waypoints are used by a model-based planner to generate a smooth and dynamically feasible trajectory that is executed on the physical system using feedback control. Our experiments in simulated real-world cluttered environments and on an actual ground vehicle demonstrate that the proposed approach can reach goal locations more reliably and efficiently in novel environments as compared to purely geometric mapping-based or end-to-end learning-based alternatives. Our approach does not rely on detailed explicit 3D maps of the environment, works well with low frame rates, and generalizes well from simulation to the real world.

We find that applying orthogonal regularization to the generator renders it amenable to a simple “truncation trick,” allowing fine control over the trade-off between sample fidelity and variety by reducing the variance of the Generator's input. Our modifications lead to models which set the new state of the art in class-conditional image synthesis. When trained on ImageNet at 128×128 resolution, our models (BigGANs) achieve an Inception Score (IS) of 166.5 and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of 7.4, improving over the previous best IS of 52.52 and FID of 18.65.},

    abstract = { Action anticipation, intent prediction, and proactive behavior are all desirable characteristics for autonomous driving policies in interactive scenarios. Paramount, however, is ensuring safety on the road: a key challenge in doing so is accounting for uncertainty in human driver actions without unduly impacting planner performance. This article introduces a minimally interventional safety controller operating within an autonomous vehicle control stack with the role of ensuring collision-free interaction with an externally controlled (e.g., human-driven) counterpart while respecting static obstacles such as a road boundary wall. We leverage reachability analysis to construct a real-time (100 Hz) controller that serves the dual role of (i) tracking an input trajectory from a higher-level planning algorithm using model predictive control, and (ii) assuring safety by maintaining the availability of a collision-free escape maneuver as a persistent constraint regardless of whatever future actions the other car takes. A full-scale steer-by-wire platform is used to conduct traffic-weaving experiments wherein two cars, initially side-by-side, must swap lanes in a limited amount of time and distance, emulating cars merging onto/off of a highway. We demonstrate that, with our control stack, the autonomous vehicle is able to avoid collision even when the other car defies the planners expectations and takes dangerous actions, either carelessly or with the intent to collide, and otherwise deviates minimally from the planned trajectory to the extent required to maintain safety. }

It is fuel efficient to minimize the relative distance between vehicles to achieve a maximum reduction in air drag. However, the relative distance can only be reduced to a certain extent without endangering a collision. Factors such as the vehicle velocity, the relative velocity, and the characteristics of the vehicle ahead has a strong impact on what minimum relative distance can be obtained. In this paper, we utilize optimal control and game theory to establish safety criteria for heavy duty vehicle platooning applications. The derived results show that a minimum relative distance of 1.2 m can be obtained for two identical vehicles without endangering a collision, assuming that there is no delay present in the feedback system. If a worst case delay is present in the system, a minimum relative distance is deduced based upon the vehicle's maximum deceleration ability. The relative distance can be reduced if the follower vehicle has a greater overall braking capability, which suggests that vehicle heterogeneity and order has substantial impact. The findings are verified by simulations and the main conclusion is that the relative distance utilized in commercial applications today can be reduced significantly with a suitable advanced cruise control system."

Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability has successfully provided these guarantees to small-scale systems and is flexible in terms of system dynamics. However, the exponential complexity scaling of HJ reachability with respect to system dimension prevents its direct application to larger-scale problems where the number of vehicles is greater than two. In this paper, we propose a collision avoidance algorithm using a hybrid framework for N + 1 vehicles through higher-level control logic given any N-vehicle collision avoidance algorithm. Our algorithm conservatively approximates a guaranteed-safe region in the joint state space of the N + 1 vehicles and produces a safety-preserving controller. In addition, our algorithm does not incur significant additional computation cost. We demonstrate our method in simulation.},

abstract = {Many Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are highly nondeterministic. This often makes it impractical to model and predict the complete system behavior. To address this problem, we propose that instead of offline modeling and verification, many CPS systems should be modeled and verified online, and we shall focus on the system's time-bounded behavior in short-run future, which is more describable and predictable. Meanwhile, as the system model is generated/updated online, the verification has to be fast. It is meaningless to tell an online model is unsafe when it is already out-dated. To demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal, we study two cases of our ongoing projects, one on the modeling and verification of a train control system, and the other on a Medical Device Plug-and-Play (MDPnP) application. Both cases are about safety-critical CPS systems. Through these two cases, we exemplify how to build online models that describe the time-bounded short-run behavior of CPS systems; and we show that fast online modeling and verification is possible.},

abstract="We present the Neural Simplex Architecture (NSA), a new approach to runtime assurance that provides safety guarantees for neural controllers (obtained e.g. using reinforcement learning) of autonomous and other complex systems without unduly sacrificing performance. NSA is inspired by the Simplex control architecture of Sha et al., but with some significant differences. In the traditional approach, the advanced controller (AC) is treated as a black box; when the decision module switches control to the baseline controller (BC), the BC remains in control forever. There is relatively little work on switching control back to the AC, and there are no techniques for correcting the AC's behavior after it generates a potentially unsafe control input that causes a failover to the BC. Our NSA addresses both of these limitations. NSA not only provides safety assurances in the presence of a possibly unsafe neural controller, but can also improve the safety of such a controller in an online setting via retraining, without overly degrading its performance. To demonstrate NSA's benefits, we have conducted several significant case studies in the continuous control domain. These include a target-seeking ground rover navigating an obstacle field, and a neural controller for an artificial pancreas system.",

   abstract = {This paper proposes a new method, that we call VisualBackProp, for visualizing which sets of pixels of the input image contribute most to the predictions made by the convolutional neural network (CNN). The method heavily hinges on exploring the intuition that the feature maps contain less and less irrelevant information to the prediction decision when moving deeper into the network. The technique we propose is dedicated for CNN-based systems for steering self-driving cars and is therefore required to run in real-time. This makes the proposed visualization method a valuable debugging tool which can be easily used during both training and inference. We justify our approach with theoretical arguments and confirm that the proposed method identifies sets of input pixels, rather than individual pixels, that collaboratively contribute to the prediction. We utilize the proposed visualization tool in the NVIDIA neural-network-based end-to-end learning system for autonomous driving, known as PilotNet. We demonstrate that VisualBackProp determines which elements in the road image most influence PilotNet's steering decision and indeed captures relevant objects on the road. The empirical evaluation furthermore shows the plausibility of the proposed approach on public road video data as well as in other applications and reveals that it compares favorably to the layer-wise relevance propagation approach, i.e. it obtains similar visualization results and achieves order of magnitude speed-ups.},

abstract="Endowing robots with the capability of assessing risk and making risk-aware decisions is widely considered a key step toward ensuring safety for robots operating under uncertainty. But, how should a robot quantify risk? A natural and common approach is to consider the framework whereby costs are assigned to stochastic outcomes--an assignment captured by a cost random variable. Quantifying risk then corresponds to evaluating a risk metric, i.e., a mapping from the cost random variable to a real number. Yet, the question of what constitutes a ``good'' risk metric has received little attention within the robotics community. The goal of this paper is to explore and partially address this question by advocating axioms that risk metrics in robotics applications should satisfy in order to be employed as rational assessments of risk. We provide instantiations of the class of risk metrics that satisfy these axioms (referred to as distortion risk metrics) and also discuss pitfalls of commonly used risk metrics in robotics that do not satisfy these axioms. Our hope is that the ideas presented here will lead to a foundational framework for quantifying risk (and hence safety) in robotics applications.",
